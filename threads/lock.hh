///
/// * `Acquire` -- wait until the lock is free and mark is as busy.
/// * `Release` -- mark the lock as free, thereby awakening some other thread
///   that were blocked on an `Acquired`.
///
/// For convenience, nobody but the thread that holds the lock can free it.
/// There is no operation for reading the state of the lock.
