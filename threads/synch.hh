/// Synchronization primitives
///
/// Data structures for synchronizing threads.
///
/// Three synchronization mechanisms are defined here: semaphores, locks and
/// condition variables. Only semaphores are implemented; for locks and
/// condition variables, only the interface is provided. Precisely, the first
/// task involves developing this implementation.
///
/// All synchronization objects have a `name` parameter in the constructor;
/// its only aim is to ease debugging the program.
